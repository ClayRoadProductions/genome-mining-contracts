# Architecture

![GEN II Brains Minting event](assets/architecture.png)

In case we want to update logic we can develop and deploy a completely new logic contract with a hard-coded storage(s) address(es). We should be able to change the address of the contract that has rights to CRUD operations:

`function updateManager(address newLogicContract) external onlyOwner {}`

Replacing the Converter contract will require 2 updates, in both storages.

To decrease the number of votes required from DAO we can use the Registry contract, that can call `updateManager()` for both storages at once.

We donâ€™t need to use it to update addresses in the logic contract, as they can be redeployed without DAO (but will still require updates in their storage).

### Pros:

low complexity, clear logic, good readability, and average development efforts.

### Cons:

Storage contracts still have some logic `updateManager()`
